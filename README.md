Introduction
What is Azure Web App?
Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

App Service not only adds the power of Microsoft Azure to your application, such as security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management. You can also take advantage of its DevOps capabilities, such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and TLS/SSL certificates.

A Web App is a web application that is hosted in an App Service.

Azure Web Apps provides a platform to build an app in Azure without having to deploy, configure and maintain your own Azure VMâ€™s.

You can build Web Apps using ASP.NET, PHP, Node.js and Python.

They also integrate common development environments like Visual Studio and GitHub.
